<h2>Simple prediction and clustering algorithms with the addition of my final AI project for AI class. The agglomerative clustering function is most likely wrong.</h2>

<h2>Final AI Proj: CDT (Custom Decision Tree) is an algorithm that mimics the ID3 decision tree but runs slightly faster. ID3 is meant to create the whole tree and then predict the results. However, CDT creates the tree along the way by narrowing down each attribute of the data using entropy. Once a "pure" result is hit, there is no need to generate the rest of the tree and the result is retrieved. Another difference is that the normalization of the data occurs when all of the data is converted into z-scores. Then, CDT splits the z-scores into bin values to find the best bin range values. These bin range values <b>should theoretically</b> determine the best bin range values to test on the specific type of data. Once the highest accuracy is received, more data can be applied using these bin range values and conceptually, predictions should become more and more precise.</h2>
